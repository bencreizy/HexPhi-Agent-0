# MISSION: SOVEREIGN LATTICE ALPHA
The objective is to operationalize a unified, local-first agency powered by the Micro-Resonance Engine.

1. **STRATEGIST**: Map user interaction to the 10-pass logic synthesis in the Python Kernel.
2. **ARCHITECT**: Maintain the triple-lobe synchronization (Node-Python-React) via the NeuroBus.
3. **ENGINEER**: Implement real-time neural alignment monitoring and memory-mapped state tracking.
4. **DEBUGGER**: Purge entropy during archetype shifts to ensure high-coherence transitions.
5. **DESIGNER**: Evolve the Sovereign Lattice UI with Phi-ratio grids and resonant flux visualizations.
6. **AUTHORITY**: Verify the security of the Omega Key CNS and maintain the 0.98 shutdown threshold.
