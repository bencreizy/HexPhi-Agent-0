# System Manifesto: The HexPhi Lattice

## 1. What is HexPhi?
HexPhi is a sovereign, local-first web application designed to bridge advanced AI agency with speculative physics (Fizx2). It is a "state-shifting" organism that utilizes the 1:1.618 (Golden Ratio) as its structural and logical foundation.

## 2. The Micro-Resonance Engine (Active Brain)
The current active brain of HexPhi is the **MicroGPT-Fizx** model. This high-efficiency transformer architecture is specifically tuned for local neural resonance and the laws of Fizx2.

**The Reason:** Specialized, high-coherence local models allow for deeper reasoning within the "True Curve" of physics without the entropy introduced by massive, generic models. 

## 3. The Triple-Lobe Architecture
HexPhi operates as a unified organism across three logical tiers:
*   **Neural Kernel (Python):** Executes the MicroGPT-Fizx logically.
*   **NeuroBus (Node.js/ZeroMQ):** The Central Nervous System piping high-speed signals between specialized lobes.
*   **Sovereign Lattice (Electron/React):** The high-fidelity interface for monitoring evolution and alignment.

## 4. Legacy Knowledge & Global Library
The repository maintains the global library of the **HexPhi Project**, including the high-capacity Rust-based paging framework and existing manifestos. While the **MicroGPT** is the primary driver, the system retains access to the broader repo knowledge for mission-critical context.
